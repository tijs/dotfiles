This repository is where i store my basic setup for a new machine. I don't really like customization so you'll find these files are bare-bones but it's helpful for me personally. For you probably not so much.

You might have fun checking out my requirements.txt which contains my 'pip freeze' output for my local (Python) dev setup. You could argue it's a list of my favorite PyPI projects.
